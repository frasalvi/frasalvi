## 🔨 Projects highlights

* [`A data-driven Political Compass`](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2021-project-alan): Analyzed a dataset of ~180 milion quotations from news media from 2008 and 2020, leveraging Topic Extraction and Sentiment Analysis to infer a new Political Compass based on quotes from US politicians.

* [`Disambiguating Voynich Manuscript transliterations`](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-scikit-learn2/): Fine-tuned word embedding models (fastText, word2vec) to disambiguate transliterations of the Voynich Manuscript, a mysterious medieval document written in a completely unknown script. Bennchmarks were built for Italian and Latin with comparable scarce data, obtaining an accuracy of 86%.
* (🇮🇹) [`Effetti di congestione per modelli di traffico su rete stradale: uno studio su Bologna`](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/23734/): Improved a traffic simulation on the Emilia-Romagna region using origin-destination data from TIM, extracting Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams and investigating the effects of hysteresis and heterogeneity.
